Food API

//Link To Live Demo:


//What does it Do?

    The app interacts between the user and a web server. The user can deliver input to the app in the form of ingredients. The app then returns a list of meals that consist those ingredients.

    

//Which Actors are in the application?


//Which API is used?
    Food-2-fork-recipe (1, 2)


//How does the interaction flow //through the application

    The app sends a XMLHttpRequest to a webserver and handles the plain text response it gets back. This response is then displayed back to the user.

//What design patterns and best //practices are used?



//What should be added in the future?

    Functionality that makes the displayed results a interactable button which on click displays more information about the meal.
